&lt;h3&gt;Power a flashlight with “Dead” Batteries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Joule Thief is a small and simple circuit that you can build that will let you power a LED flashlight with batteries that you consider “dead”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries that you throw away still have power in them, but most battery-powered devices only operate in a small &lt;em&gt;Voltage Range&lt;/em&gt;. Because batteries only supply a steady amount of voltage for a little while, devices stop working before the battery is fully out of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t try to explain how voltage works here, because you may already know, and if you don’t, I don’t know that I could give the ‘correct’ explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basics of what this circuit does is take electricity that is &lt;em&gt;higher amperage and lower voltage&lt;/em&gt; and makes it so that it can be used to power a Light Emitting Diode, by reducing the amperage and raising the voltage — but it is more fun to build it, wonder at it, and then learn about how it works. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name suggests the notion that the circuit is stealing energy — a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"&gt;Joule&lt;/a&gt; is unit of energy — from the battery. The term is a pun on the expression “jewel thief”, one who steals jewelry or gemstones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parts List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to have the bits. The nice thing about this project is everything can be salvaged from recycled electronics. All the parts are also easily available online, and at many DIY stores like Radioshack. You will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/1-parts-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A TRANSISTOR:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This needs to be a “NPN Signal Transistor”. The following types have been confirmed to work with this project: 2N3904 (very common), PN2222A, and C1815. Whatever kind you choose, and whether you buy or salvage it, make sure you know the ‘Pinout’. The pins will be labeled E (for Emitter), B (for Base), and C (for Collector) — for the rest of this tutorial we will be working with the 2N3904, which has a pinout, left to right, of EBC when looked at from the front (flat) side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 1k (1,000) &amp;#8486; RESISTOR:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Resistors are measured in Ohms (&amp;#8486;), and the one we need has a resistance of 1,000 Ohms, abbreviated 1k&amp;#8486;. Resistors are not labeled with a value, but instead have colour codes: a 1k&amp;#8486; resistor will have colour bands Brown–Black–Red with another band slightly farther away, which will most likely be gold. You can learn to read resistor colour codes &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_color_code"&gt;on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (LED):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;These come in all shapes and sizes, and it is up to you what colour and size you use as long as it works. A common type is shown in the parts photo, and has a 5mm body. These are often red or white. Keep in mind that LEDs are Polarity sensitive, so get it the right way around when you build the circuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “FERRITE TOROID”:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is a small blob of ground up iron held together with glue. When you wrap a bunch of wire around it in a special way that I’ll describe later, it does funny things to the electricity in the wire and makes our circuit work.You can order one online or at radio shack, or salvage one out of a dead electronic device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“MAGNET WIRE”:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is the name for thin copper wire that is coated in varnish. Magnet wire is used in motors, transformers, and other electronic gadgets. It can easily be salvaged from old transformers. You can also get it online or from radio shack. You only need a little bit of it for this project — about 6 feet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DEAD BATTERY (OR TWO):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A single AA that you have used a bit should work well for the circuit. If you have a multimeter, you can test your battery: if its voltage is between .8 of a volt and 2 volts, it should work. You may want a holder for it, but that’s optional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “SOLDERLESS BREADBOARD”:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Breadboards are made of plastic and have terminals inside them, so you just insert the wires into the little holes the breadboard, and they will connect to other wires inserted into the same Row. Because breadboards don’t require soldering, they’re reusable. This makes it easy to use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build the Circuit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Breadboards Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Breadboard — view from back" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/2-breadboard-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a photo of the back side of a small breadboard. As you can see, rows of metal run out from the centre. On the other side there are holes to insert wires or component leads. When a wire is inserted, it comes in contact with the metal &lt;em&gt;row&lt;/em&gt; and becomes connected to anything inserted into the same row. On larger breadboards, there are often “Bus” strips, which run along the edges, separately and in the opposite direction. Keep this in mind if you are using a larger breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Transistor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/3-transistor-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop the transistor in as shown, with each lead inserted into a separate &lt;em&gt;row&lt;/em&gt; of the breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Resistor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/4-resistor-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the resistor so that one of its leads goes in the same row as the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Base&lt;/em&gt; (the centre lead for 2N2222A and 2N3904 transistors, such as the one shown). The other lead of the resistor can go into the row two to the right of the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Collector&lt;/em&gt;, as shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The LED&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/5-led-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the LED so that the Negative (-) lead goes in the same row as the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Emitter&lt;/em&gt; (if you use a 2N3904 or PN2222A, this is the left lead), and the Positive (+) lead goes in the same row as the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Collector&lt;/em&gt; (if you use a 2N3904 or PN2222A, this is the right lead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell which is the positive lead of an LED because the part it’s attached to inside is smaller. If it is a new LED that you bought, the negative side of the lens will have a flat spot, and the positive lead will be longer. You can test an LED easily with a 3 volt battery to check its polarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Winding the Coil&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/6-winding-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coil ‘winds up’ being the most critical component in this circuit. Here’s how to wind it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a generous amount of &lt;em&gt;Magnet Wire&lt;/em&gt; — around six feet, depending on the size of your Toroid — and cut it into two equal lengths. You can also just fold it over on itself for the winding, and cut it when you are done.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the two wires side by side and pass them through the Toroid, so that they form a full turn around the toroid, and are next to each other. It is important that they &lt;strong&gt;NEVER CROSS&lt;/strong&gt;. Draw them tight.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat until you have 11 to 17 wraps with each wire. Make sure you keep them tight and make sure they never cross, and that you keep them as a pair (as shown). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are done, you need to remove the varnish from the four wire ends so that you can connect them to other components. This can be done by burning it off with a lighter, sanding it off, or scraping it off with a knife. Sanding is the most civilized option.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the photo above I have flagged one wire with tape at each end. It is important to know which wire is which when you are done. This is easily done with an Ohm-meter (check which of the four wire ends are connected to each other), but it can also be done by staring at it long enough.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the two ends that &lt;strong&gt;are not the same wire&lt;/strong&gt; and are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;not from the same end of the coil&lt;/strong&gt;, and twist them together. This forms the &lt;em&gt;Center-tap&lt;/em&gt; of the coil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Coil&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/7-coil-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert the &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; coil leads into the breadboard, one in the row with the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Collector&lt;/em&gt; and the LEDs positive terminal, and one into the row with the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Emitter&lt;/em&gt; and the LEDs negative terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Wire&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/8-wire-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert a short length of solid-core wire into the same row as the transistor’s &lt;em&gt;Emitter&lt;/em&gt;. This is your negative power lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;See if it Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="The Finished Product" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/joule-thief/9-test-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re done ... hopefully. Let’s test the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take one last check to make sure everything is wired correctly (check the polarity of the LED &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; transistor!), and make sure you got the windings on the Toroid right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything seems A-OK, touch the negative power wire (which should be black) to the negative terminal of the battery and the positive power wire (the &lt;em&gt;Center Tap&lt;/em&gt; of the Toroid) to the positive terminal of the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lights? Camera? Action? &lt;strong&gt;If the LED lit up and you let out a shout of victory, you are done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One small note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Depending on how fresh the battery or batteries are, it is possible for the circuit to make too much power for the LED. If the LED is bright when you first turn it on, and then dims — particularly if it also changes colour — it is likely getting too much power. In this case you should replace the LED and try again with a weaker power source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Technical Digression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Joule Thief Schematic" src="http://localhost/scienceclass/output/images/joule-thief/10-schematic-full-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have this neat circuit that you built with your own two hands, and chances are you don’t have a clue how it actually works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Wikipedia article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit uses the self-oscillating properties of the blocking oscillator, to form an unregulated voltage boost converter. As with all power conversion technology, no energy is actually created by the circuit (in accordance with the law of conservation of energy). Instead, the output voltage is increased at the expense of higher current draw on the input. As a result, the amount of power entering the circuit is the same as the amount leaving, plus the losses in the conversion process. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule-Thief"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some places where you can learn how the circuit actually works:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create motion with Electricity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project you will build a simple motor powered by Direct Current. It uses as few parts as possible, and is easy to build with common components. It is a fun demonstration of how electricity can be converted to motion, and of the interactions between electromagnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bill of Materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="The parts for a DC Induction Motor" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/1-parts-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project you will need:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NEODYMIUM MAGNET (NOT PICTURED):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;In this tutorial we used a 1/2" x 1/8" disc magnet, but it will also work well with a 1/4" x 1/4" or 1/4" x 1/2" rod magnet.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAGNET WIRE (~10ft of ~22 AWG):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Magnet wire is coated in a thin layer of varnish that insulates it; it can be salvaged from a transformer or motor, and for this project should be about 22AWG (American Wire Gauge), or just stiff enough to support itself when coiled.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINDING FORM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This can be any cylindrical object around an inch in diameter, and the exact size is not crucial. This is what you will wind the coil around. I used a large capacitor because it had a slight groove in it, but a pill bottle or cardboard tube would work as well.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNCOATED STEEL OR COPPER WIRE (~10"):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This will be used to both get power to the coil and to support it, so it should be stiff and uncoated.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A PIECE OF SAND PAPER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Between 100 and 400 grit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOODEN BASE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Balsa wood works well because it is easy to cut, but you can use any insulating material you’re comfortable working with — such as wood, plastic, or cardboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12V DC POWER SOURCE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This motor is far from efficient, and if the wire you use is thick it will use as much power as it can get. A 1+ amp 12V DC adapter or bench power supply will work well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wind the coil&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Wind the coil" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/2-winding-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind about 15 turns of magnet wire onto your coil form, leaving a few inches of wire on either end of the coil. Unlike the Joule Thief’s Toroid, you don’t have to worry about overlapping turns on the coil — they might even make it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: As you can see, the wire was quite bent up in the parts photo, because it was salvaged from an old motor. If you salvage wire, straighten it before winding the coil by looping it around some solid object (like the strut of a chair back), and pulling the two ends back and forth until the kinks are smoothed out. Just don’t use your Grandma’s antique chair, because it will put a notch in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Finish the coil&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="The Coil" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/3-coil-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carefully slide the coil off the form. Wrap each of the loose ends around the main bundle of wire a few times to hold it together. Make sure they come out directly opposite each other and are as straight as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have just made the &lt;strong&gt;Armature&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll continue calling it the coil because it is less technical, but don’t forget to pull out this handy buzzword when you explain it to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sand the wire&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Sand the Wire" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/4-sanding-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the coil as shown — vertically, with the side your’re working on supported — and sand the varnish off of &lt;strong&gt;only one side&lt;/strong&gt; of each of the wires — make sure it is &lt;strong&gt;the same side&lt;/strong&gt; for both wires. This is one of the most important steps to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you are sanding the varnish off one side the wire for its whole length, not sanding all the varnish off the wire for half of its length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Make the Supports&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Bending the Supports" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/5-bending-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Finished Supports" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/6-support-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut two equal lengths of stiff steel wire. Bend small v-shaped cradles into one end to support the coil and get power to it, and bend horizontal squares into the other, so make it easier to glue it to the baseplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attach the supports&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Attach the Supports" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/7-glued-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glue the two supports so that the vertical part of the supports are across from each other — centred on the board in one direction, and about 1 1/2 inches apart in the other. Hot glue works well for this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attach the Magnet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Add the Magnet" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/8-done-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to get the magnet &lt;strong&gt;as close to the coil as possible&lt;/strong&gt; without it rubbing. Depending on how tall you made the supports, you may have to put a riser under the magnet — in the version pictured, I made the supports too tall, and used a section of hot glue stick to mount the magnet at the correct height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what pole of the magnet is facing up for this project — which way the power is applied and which way the magnet is oriented will determine which way the motor spins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attach Power&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Power it Up" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/9-power-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clip test leads from your 12V DC source onto the vertical supports (or solder to them, or wrap wires around them. It doesn’t matter, but test leads are the most convenient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fire it Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Get it started" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/10-testing-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the coil in the cradle. Because of the way the wire is sanded, you will likely need to give it at little push to get it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motor will want to spin in one direction, so experiment to see which way it turns, and give it its boost in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fine Tune&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="grayscale"&gt; 
    &lt;img alt="Running" src="http://scienceclass.github.io/images/dc-motor/11-running-crop.png" /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the best performance, you will need to tune the motor in the following ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure that the coil wires are perfectly straight&lt;/strong&gt; and that the coil spins easily in the cradle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it is running, watch which way the coil migrates.&lt;/strong&gt; If one vertical support is higher, it will drift to the other side. Adjust the supports’ height so that the coil remains centred between them when it’s running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust the sanding job&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure that the side which has the varnished removed has it all the way removed and extends half way around the wire (or maybe a little bit more), and that the side with the varnish still on is fully coated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your’re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motor doesn’t run, it is most likely from one of these causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The coil wires aren’t straight enough&lt;/strong&gt; This will make it harder for the coil to spin. Adjust them as necessary.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your power source is too weak&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a power hungry motor, and it is possible that (combined with other factors) a weak power source could make it not run. Make sure your power source is delivering at least 12V DC at 1+ Amp.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not enough of the varnish is removed.&lt;/strong&gt; You may need to sand slightly more than half of the varnish off for optimum performance.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Technical Digression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially what is happening is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The part of the wire with the varnish removed comes in contact with the support, and delivers power to the coil  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The powered coil is repulsed by the magnet, and starts to spin so that it is farther away from it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it spins, the half of the wire with the varnish still on comes in contact with the support, cutting power to the coil. This means that the coil can finish its rotation using its momentum without being repulsed as the coil approaches the magnet.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the coil is past the magnet, the unvarnished half of the wire comes in contact, activating the coil. The cycle repeats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
