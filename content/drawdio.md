The Drawdio is a simple musical synthesizer that uses the conductive properties of pencil graphite to create different sounds. It was designed by [Jay Silver](http://web.media.mit.edu/~silver/drawdio/) and makes use of the famous 555 timer chip. 

It is now a [popular beginner electronics kit](http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mkad12.htm). The kit costs $19 — however, the circuit was released under the Creative Commons license, and the plans are freely available: Why not build one from scratch?

I built the one in the photos in under an hour, and because I salvaged everything other than the 555 Timer chip and the transistor, it cost less than a dollar.

### Building it

Unlike many electronics projects, there are clear instructions freely available for the Drawdio. Therefor, it is unnecessary for me to write a full build tutorial. I built the prototype from Make’s tutorial video:

More information can be found on [Jay Silver’s Site](http://web.media.mit.edu/~silver/drawdio/), and the [Make: Project](http://makezine.com/projects/drawdio-musical-pencil/)

### My Modifications

All the tutorials I ran across called for the low-power [CMOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmos) chip [TCL555](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer#Derivatives), and I only had the original 5V 555s on hand, so I substituted it and used 5V instead of 3V. Here is the finished product:

### Schematic

Here is a (somewhat shabby) schematic I drew. It uses the original 5v 555 chip, and also corrects a mistake in the battery symbol used by Make (their schematic had the battery symbol backwards)
