Title: Making Science Interesting

Summary: Science is fascinating. There’s a common misconception that science must be *made interesting* — that it must be dressed up in flashy clothes and simplified for people not on tenure to be interested in it, to make it ‘cool’. I believe that **science speaks for itself,** and that there are few things more wonderful than watching it in action and experimenting with it …

Science is fascinating. There’s a common misconception that science must be *made interesting* — that it must be dressed up in flashy clothes and simplified for people not on tenure to be interested in it. I believe that **science speaks for itself,** and that there are few things more wonderful than watching it in action and experimenting with it.

Look up at the Milky Way way at night: that’s science. Rockets, stinks <span class="amp">&amp;</span> bangs, this website, the internet — it’s all science. Even boring things like video games have science in them (there’s a lot of mathematics and physics involved in, say, Angry Birds). 

That’s is what this alleged ‘Science Class’ thing is about: Building things with science, recreating discoveries that have been taken for granted (possibly even forgotten by most people) for hundreds or thousands of years, and having a good time in the process. It’s science without Comic Sans, bright colors, and affectation. (yeah, I have kind of a *thing* about [Comic Sans](http://comicsanscriminal.com).)

I attempt to take the middle road between simple and comprehensive. I don’t use large technical words unnecessarily, but I’m not writing in Simple English, either; if worst comes to worst, my more complicated ramblings can be thought of as vocabulary exercise. Also, I’m not attempting to explain the basic principles behind the projects in most cases. I would rather focus on what other sites don’t cover as well: neat and occasionally offbeat science projects that actually work. I usually link to resources that explain the principles involved more throughly — although note that it may take a Quantum Physicist to be able to **accurately** explain many of the fundamentals of science.

You may wonder, *What’s not boring about spinning puny little wires with electricity?* Everyone has their own reasons to learn about science, from practical to philosophic; but when it comes down to it, **it’s usually about Curiosity.** And since you’re on this website, you probably have a lion’s share of it.
