Title: Invisible Ink

Status: draft
Summary: This Scienceclass-original Invisible ink formula can be made from household materials, as well as being more effective, and harder to break than more common recipies.

Have you ever wanted to communicate with only one person? To write a letter that couldn’t be snooped on? Now you can.

With this Science Class-Original invisible ink, you can write secret messages that reveal themselves only when washed in the developing solution described here.

### Bill of Materials

- **WHITE VINEGAR (10% ACETIC ACID), 1/2 CUP:** *Household White Vinegar is a chemical called Acetic Acid diluted with water (in more technical terms, CH3CO2H + H2O). Acetic acid in one of the ‘Reagents’ needed for the developing solution.*

- **FINE STEEL WOOL, 1" WAD:** *Iron, in the form of Steel Wool, is the second Reagent needed for the developing solution. Steel wool is used because of it’s high surface area, which accelerates the reaction, and easy availability. Iron powder or filings could also be used.*

- **HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (MINIMUM 3% v/w), 2 TABLESPOONS:** *This is the invisible ink. It is clear, and once it is dry is invisible on the page until it reacts with the developing solution.*

- **A GLASS BOTTLE, BEAKER, OR FLASK:** *Any small non-reactive vessel will work. This is where the developing solution will be prepared.*

- **CLING WRAP & AN ELASTIC:** *These keep the air out of the bottle where the developing solution is being prepared, but allows the gas produced to escape.*

- **WRITING IMPLEMENT[S]:** *Use whatever works for you — a paintbrush, Q-Tip, dip-pen, or quill.*

- **THICK WHITE PAPER:** *This is better than regular bond paper because the ink won’t bleed through as much.*

- **SMALL, FINE-MIST SPRAYBOTTLE (OPTIONAL):** *Although you can dab the developing solution onto the message, this makes the process easier.*

### Prepare the Developing Solution

The first step is to prepare a weak Iron II Acetate (Fe(CH3CO2)) solution. Iron II Acetate is produced by the chemical reaction of Iron and Acetic Acid. To work, the reaction must take place in an *Anerobic* environment — that is, air has to be kept out of the bottle you prepare it in. 

In practical terms, you put a wad of steel wool in a glass bottle, fill it up with vinegar, and cover it to keep air out. The steel wool slowly dissovles and makes bubbles of gas (hydrogen). After a few days of bubbling it should be still clear (or very nearly so) and is ready for use.

To avoid blowing up the jar you make it in, there has to be a way for the gas produced to escape, *without letting air in to replace it*. This is done simply with cling wrap and an elastic, as described later on.

Place the wad of steel wool in the jar.

Fill the jar with vinegar, making sure that the steel wool is covered.

Place a piece of cling wrap over the opening.

Elastic band the cling wrap in place.

Watch small bubble form on the steel wool as the reaction begins. The cling wrap will bulge, and you may hear a periodic hiss as the gas escapes.

**Wait two to three days, while the reaction runs its course.**

### Write a Message


<span class="grayscale">

</span>

Dip your writing implement in Hydrogen Peroxide and write your secret letter, message, or tome. Let it dry.


### Reveal a Message

</span>

Lightly mist a message written with the peroxide ink with developing solution to reveal it. The writing will appear reddish brown before your eyes.

### Further Ideas

A blank letter is, to put it mildly, a bit of a giveaway ... which may prompt third parties to try to discover its message! 

Consider writing a letter discussing the weather, and write your secret message on the back or between the lines.

### A Brief History

Although I’ve done hundreds or thousands of science experiments, this one stands out as one of the most unique, as it is one of the few true chemistry discoveries I’ve made. 

I discovered this ink by chance when I was about ten; during a particularly science-crazed time of my youth between the ages of ten and fourteen, when I spent many of my waking hours experimenting with Chemistry — and, when absolutely necessary, studying the theory of it.

When I first launched scienceclass, I remembered this experiment, but not perfectly. This morning I came across an old notebook in which I had described the ink when I discovered it. The illiterate scrawl was intended for the chemistry book I was ‘writing’ at the time, and though that never came to pass, it allowed me to recreate the experiment for scienceclass.

### A Technical Digression

When I originally conducted the experiment, I wrote that vinegar and steel wool react to form Iron Acetate, which is oxidized to Iron Hydroxide when it comes in contact with the hydrogen peroxide ink (H2O2).

*Fe + CH3CO2H —> Fe(CH3CO2) + H2

or 

Iron + Acetic Acid —> Iron II Acetate + Hydrogen Gas

or

Steel Wool and Vinegar —> smelly clear liquid that turns brown for no reason.*

[WolframAlpha](http://wolframalpha.com) returned ‘Unspecifide Products’ for both reactions, and theoretical chemistry has never been my strong point; however, I believe my previous description was correct as far as it went.

Naturally, there’s water <span class="amp">&amp;</span> impurities that I’m not including in the chemical formulas — but they aren’t significant to the outcome of this experiment.

The Iron II Acetate is formed in is the ionic form, and when it reacts with the hydrogen peroxide it forms Iron III Hydroxide:

Fe(CH3CO2)2 + H2O2 —> (CH3CO2H)2 + FeO+O (or FeO2)
